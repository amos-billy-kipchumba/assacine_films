          <h4>Assacine Films is an independent production company
            incorporated in Kenya (Company Registration No – PVT -9XUGYK8M ).  The company is engaged in the production of diverse African content, from feature films and TV dramas to commercial advertising projects using AR and VR technology.  Our stories, from award-winning scripts and from different countries, feature compelling stories and unique characters and will be made by highly skilled personnel to maximize production value.</h4>

          <div class="mission-beyond-left">
            <h2 class="">Our Mission</h2>
            <h4 class="">The mission of Assacine Films is to offer high quality entertainment with social relevance while laying the foundation for a Kenyan film industry made up of creative storytellers and highly skilled crew that will appeal to international production companies. What we put on the screen will be our company’s resume. This emphasis on quality and responsibility, coupled with the attitude and experience of a great management team, will enable Assacine Films to emerge as the preferred choice or partner for Feature Film, TV, and other Multimedia content such as Augmented Reality(AR) or Virtual Reality (VR) from Africa.</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="mission-beyond-right">
            <h2 class="">Films for Africa and the World beyond</h2>
            <h4 class="">In recent years, the Film and TV audience in Africa has become overwhelmingly receptive to homegrown or “local” productions. In fact, African audiences now purchase more of this type of content than the entertainment options offered by Hollywood and the West. After evaluating trends in the industry, Assacine has determined that the time is right for high-quality African- themed productions that will appeal to audiences on the African continent as well as the African diaspora in the United States and Europe.</h4>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="home-grown">
          <h2 class="">The Homegrown Advantage</h2>
          <h4 class="">There have been many award-winning motion pictures set in Africa but made by foreign film and TV companies from Hollywood or Europe, most of which featured a non-African hero/heroine or a production team that was not from Africa. Assacine will engage in productions of TV dramas and films featuring Africans as the main characters and made by mostly local crews. This will enable us to drastically cut down production costs while taking advantage of partnerships with US media technology companies to develop state-of-the-art facilities and a highly-skilled film production workforce in Africa.</h4>
